Whether it's simulating a forest management treatment or forecasting the effects of a natural disturbance, models are required tools for understanding how forests will grow.\n\nIncreasingly, models are being used to understand forest carbon stocks and stock changes. As we strive to quantify the role of forests in offsetting carbon dioxide emissions, having reliable tools to understand forest dynamics is essential. The use of models are also required in many forest carbon programs, for example, the [California Air Resources Board’s Compliance Offset Program](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/compliance-offset-program/compliance-offset-protocols/us-forest-projects/models).   \n\nThis post describes two commonly used models being used to forecast forest carbon. Both rely on information to forecast forest dynamics and carbon stocks and stock changes into the future. Although one was developed in the US and one in Canada, both models are being used across country boundaries.\n\nThe [Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS)](https://www.fs.usda.gov/fvs/index.shtml) is a model developed by the USDA Forest Service in 1973. The FVS model is an individual tree model that uses lists of trees (e.g., species and tree diameter) to forecast forest growth through time. The model can simulate forest management activities, disturbances, and provide forest carbon and harvested wood products reports. A series of 22 different model variants provide regional differences in forest growth patterns.\n\nThere has been a tremendous amount of research and development on the FVS model through time. Their website contains excellent supporting information, video tutorials, and documentation. Although the model was originally developed in the US, here are a few applications of it in Canada:\n\n* An [Acadian variant of FVS](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324705922_The_Acadian_Variant_of_the_Forest_Vegetation_Simulator_Continued_development_and_evaluation) is available for Maine and the Canadian Maritime provinces, and\n* The FVS model has been calibrated for [Ontario's forests](https://cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/publications?id=28760).\n \n\n## The CBM-CFS3 model\nThe [Carbon Budget Model of the Canadian Forest Service 3 (CBM-CFS 3)](https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/climate-change-adapting-impacts-and-reducing-emissions/climate-change-impacts-forests/carbon-accounting/carbon-budget-model/13107) is a model developed by the Canadian Forest Service in 2002. The model simulates carbon dynamics following the Good Practice Guidance established by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for reporting on carbon stocks and stock changes. The model works on an operational scale and is well suited for landscape-level predictions, but it can also operate at the stand level. Although the model was originally developed by the Canadian Forest Service, it has been applied in the US as well:\n\n* An [analysis in seven US states](https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/2021-22-fcwg-learning-exchange-series-modeling-forest-management-and-carbon-a-tool-for-state-wide-planning-and-action) used Forest Inventory and Analysis data in CBM-CFS3 to understand carbon impacts resulting from forest management.\n* A recent analysis integrated [CBM-CFS3 with a land use and land cover change model](https://cbmjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13021-022-00201-1) to understand spatially explicit estimates of carbon stocks and fluxes. \n\nAs for me, I've been a long time FVS user and am beginning to hear more about applications of CBM-CFS3 as a carbon accounting tool.
