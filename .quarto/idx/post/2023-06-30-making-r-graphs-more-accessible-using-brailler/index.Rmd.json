In it, they describe the R package **BrailleR** and how it can be used to generate text from figures made in R. This post describes a few example uses of the functions found within the package.\n\n\nI've read online that R is a software program that is already friendly for the blind and visually impaired. The **BrailleR** package contains functions that do more to help blind and visually impaired people interpret graphs and figures produced in R.\n\nYou can install the R package and load it in your workspace:\n\n```{r, warning = F, message = F}\n# install.packages(\"BrailleR\")\nlibrary(BrailleR)\n```\n\n\nAs an example, I'll show a series of graphs using the `redpine` data set available in the **stats4nr** package. Data contain information collected from 450 red pine trees in Minnesota, including their diameter at breast height (`DBH`) and total height (`HT). Data were collected from various forest cover types (`CoverType`*`) and forest inventory plots (`PlotNum`) across the forest:\n\n```{r}\n# install.packages(\"devtools\")\n\n# devtools::install_github(\"mbrussell/stats4nr\")\n\nlibrary(stats4nr)\n\ndata(redpine)\n\nredpine\n```\n\n\nWe can make a plot of tree height and diameter using the following code from `ggplot`:\n\n```{r, message = F, warning = F}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\np_HT <- ggplot(redpine, aes(DBH, HT)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(x = \"Diameter at breast height (inches)\",\n       y = \"Height (feet)\",\n       title = \"Red pine height-diameter observations\")\n```\n\nWhen we call the `p_HT` object, the **BrailleR** package provides the graph in addition to four lines of text describing what's contained in the plot:\n\n```{r}\np_HT\n```\n\nThe output reads us the title of the plot, the axis labels and axis titles, and the number of data points. This is all very helpful attributes for interpreting the plot and can be read on the screen.\n\nThe data are collected from different cover types, so we can add a different color for each tree using `col = CoverType` and produce the results: \n\n```{r}\np_HT2 <- ggplot(redpine, aes(DBH, HT, col = CoverType)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(x = \"Diameter at breast height (inches)\",\n       y = \"Height (feet)\",\n       title = \"Red pine height-diameter observations\")\n\np_HT2\n```\n\nNow, you can see the additional detail of the number of levels in each cover type and their colors.\n\nThe **BrailleR package also works for graphics developed in base R, which can be specified with the `VI()` function. Here's a histogram of the height of red pines.\n\n```{r}\nVI(hist(redpine$HT))\n```\n\nThe functions available in **BrailleR** are a great start for generating alt text copy that can be used on a figure or image. But they won't tell you the trends in the data or the \"big message\" that you want to leave your reader with. This is essential to have an effective graphic.\n\nFor this, Amy Cesal has any [excellent post on writing alt-text images](https://medium.com/nightingale/writing-alt-text-for-data-visualization-2a218ef43f81). Her template is to use:\n\n> \"**CHART TYPE** *of* **TYPE OF DATA** *where* **REASON FOR INCUDING CHART**.\"\n\nFor example, for the first figure plotting tree diameter and height, one could provide the following for the alt text description:\n\n> \"**Scatter plot** *of* **red pine tree diameters and heights** *where* **larger diameter trees are taller than shorter ones**.\"\n\nIn combination with the text provided by **BrailleR**, these steps can help improve the accessibility of your graphs and figures made in R. For more, a great resource I found for learning more about the **BrailleR** package is the book [BrailleR In Action](https://r-resources.massey.ac.nz/BrailleRInAction/) by A. Jonathan R.
