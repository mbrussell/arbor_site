Trees sequester carbon dioxide and turn it into wood, storing carbon in forests and long-lived forest products for long time periods. Despite the increased recognition of carbon as a natural climate solution and several emerging markets that monetize it, few professionals in forestry and natural resources have a grasp on the amount and extent of forest carbon in the ecosystems they work in.\n\nIn *Forest Carbon by the Numbers*, I share insights and visualizations of the current status and trends in forest carbon and how it impacts the forest products industry.\n\nIn *Forest Carbon by the Numbers*, you will understand:\n\n* Terminology associated with forest carbon measurements and markets,\n* How forest carbon is quantified (from individual tree to landscape scales),\n* How to leverage forest inventory data to understand forest biomass and carbon, and\n* Trends and future opportunities in forest carbon.\n\n[GET THE EBOOK](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09CC1WT69) to learn more about forest carbon and how it can be better understood in your own organization.\n\n--\n\n*By Matt Russell.
