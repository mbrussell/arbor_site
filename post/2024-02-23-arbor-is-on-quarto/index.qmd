I've recently moved the Arbor Custom Analytics website to [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), an open source publishing system. It's built on top of Jupyter and Markdown, and it's a great fit for ou work.

Most of the content has ported over, but a few older blog posts might be missing. If you're looking for something specific and don;t see it, feel free [to reach out](mailto: matt@arbor-analytics.com).
