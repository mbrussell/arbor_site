A [new web application](https://matt-arbor.shinyapps.io/forestry_pandemic/) is now available that summarizes these pandemic assistance programs and funding provided to each individual state.\n \n\n[You can access the web app here.](https://matt-arbor.shinyapps.io/forestry_pandemic/)\n\nThe app uses data presented in the paper [**A summary of COVID-19 pandemic assistance to US forest products companies**](https://meridian.allenpress.com/fpj/article/72/4/253/488883/A-Summary-of-COVID-19-Pandemic-Assistance-to-US), published in the *Forest Products Journal* in late 2022. Values include:\n\n* Number of loans/payments offered to forest products companies,\n* Average loan/payment amounts,\n* Total value of loans/payment provided to state,\n* Average number of forest products jobs supported per loan,\n* Total number of forest products jobs supported in state,\n* Average gross revenue lost in 2020 per business, and\n* Total gross revenue lost by state in 2020\n\nData for the PPP and PATHH programs are presented for each US state plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.  \n\n--\n\n*By Matt Russell.
